		<h1>Books</h1>
		<p>
		Just like when Im out in nature, I have never felt that time spent reading 		a book is wasted time. There is one problem though: I tend to forget 			parts of the books I read. Therefor I will do a short writeup about the 		books I read on my webpage. This way I can go back to the key concepts and 		since I'm writing it down I will further press the information in my brain. 


I believe in learning by teaching and 

 That way I will repeat what I've learnt and I can also 		go back and get the key concepts.
